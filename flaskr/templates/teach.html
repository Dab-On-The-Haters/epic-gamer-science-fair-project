                    To teach the neural networks English, Joe requires a large amount of text files. These textfiles are compiled into a dataset, which are used to teach models.
                    Since models start with no understanding of words, grammar, or even letters, it's important this the dataset is extremely large so that it can have enough data to learn.

                    and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, a collection of books with expired copyright. Some examples of fun datasets are food reviews,
                    book series', tweets, and scripts.

                <p>
                    AI data is stored and generated in instances called &quot;models&quot;.
                    These models are essentially the AI behind Joe. They are trained (developed) on our server, and text can be generated from these later.
                    Usually, the text generated from the model is quite similar to the sort of stuff provided in the dataset it's trained on.
